#PORTOBELLO CAFE

Hello, this is my first project. I've attempted to create a website for a cafe/coffee shop. The learning experience has been enjoyable and i look forward to many more projects.

#Backgroud

Portobello Cafe, is a cafe located in a small coastal town, in northern Morocco.
The town is populular with day trippers, coming in from Spain exploring the medina and beach goers.
This family frienly coffee shop, serves barista style coffee, pastries, breakfast and all day hearty Moroccan dishes.

#Planning

For my first project i wanted to keep things simply. In the planning stage, I thought about what can be displyed in a website for a coffee shop.

    Location 
        - Where the cafe is located, with map included.
    Menu 
        - photos, description, price and allegegy information
    Services
        - Amenities offered such as wifi and function room
    Contact
        - phone number, email and social media taggs.


I then had to think about how i was gonna layout the page and for that i needed to create a wireframe. I used a site called figma to draw and design the wireframe, keeping as simple as possible.

#Code

Using html and css, I began to generate content on the page. Not knowing how i would style it, I played around with different font types and styles.

I used google to find images to use and W3C for tutrials along with youtube videos. Thanks to the guidance from my tutor Kamal Karir, I knew what to look for.

#Challenges

My biggest learning curve, was probaby padding and floating iteams across. This also help me understand div functions better.
